    <h2>About Tiffany</h2>
    <p>
      Tiffy is a travel planning freak, formerly an Asia Pacific finance manager
      and currently a digital marketing ninja. Despite being a nervous flyer
      with plane jolts sending chills down her spine, Tiffy’s wanderlust has led
      her to visit Japan for 6 times (and counting). Her favorite cities are
      Kyoto and Tokyo and would choose to visit Japan over Paris in a heartbeat!
